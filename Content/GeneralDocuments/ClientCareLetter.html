<br/>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
Your Instructions
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
Our Advice
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>


Steps you must take and your obligations in relation to your instructions to us
To enable us to provide you with the best service possible, you are committing yourself
to ensure that:
1. You always keep us updated whenever any of your contact details change. We need
to be able to contact you when necessary.
2. You will inform us of any change of circumstances relevant to your case. You are responsible
for providing us with the necessary information about your circumstances.
3. You will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions.
4. You will provide all necessary documentation required in support of your case and to
complete the matter in a timely manner.
5. You will safeguard and provide any documents which are likely to be required for the
matter.
Please note that we have advised you on the basis of the information you have provided
us, as outlined above in this letter. If your circumstances change in a way that affects
our advice, you will need to let us know as soon as possible so that we may review our
opinion and, if necessary, advise you again to reflect the change of circumstances. 

<br/><br/>

<u>Professional Fees</u>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
Our agreed fee for this matter is £ to represent you in relation to your immigration
matter. This fee includes making representations to the Home Office on your behalf,
drafting, preparing, completing and submitting your application to the Home Office, informing
you of any developments as and when they arise, liaising with the Home Office
whilst your application is pending consideration and submission of all necessary documentation.
It does not include the Home Office application fees and disbursements. It
does not also include any other third party fees or any other future work in your file.
Please note that this fee must be paid in full up front at the beginning of our acting for
you. This fee will remain in our client’s account until the work is done and the application
is submitted. The Home Office application fees will be paid directly from our client account.

Please note that this fee will be subject to variation in the case of a matter becoming
protracted or other complications arising. This fee would not cover any other matter in
your file and if a situation arises that any further work should be done on your file, a fee
must be agreed prior to work being undertaken on your behalf. The total fee for assisting
you may increase dependent on the amount of work undertaken.
We charge for the work carried out on the case irrespective of the outcome. We do not
operate on a “no win no fee basis”.
Once we undertake work and carry it out, which includes administrative work, we are not
under any obligation for a refund, We reserve the right to recover any outstanding balance
from a client who withdraws instructions once the work has been carried out. 
Whilst we are representing you, we shall do our best to respond promptly to letters or
calls made to our office but ask you to understand that at bust times an immediate reply
is not always possible. In particular, we ask all our clients not to attend our office in person
except by prior appointment. If you need to see a member of staff urgently, it is always
best to telephone first, as you may not be seen otherwise.

<br/><br/><br/>
<u>Free Help and Assistance</u>
<br/><br/><br/>
You should also be aware that Firms such as Citizens Advice Bureau, Law Centre and
Immigration Advisory Service may be able to provide you with advice and representation
in immigration matters free of charge. If you wish to consult them, their number can be
found in the Local Telephone Directory

<u>Legal Aid or funding from the Legal Services Commission</u>
<br/><br/><br/>
If you are on a low income or receiving welfare benefits, you may qualify for Legal Help
under the Community Legal Services Scheme to assist you with your case. Please note
that our organisation does not represent clients free under that scheme. If therefore you
would prefer to be represented by the Community Legal Services adviser, please let us
know immediately and we shall tell you where you can get possible alternative representation.
<br/><br/><br/>


<u>Professional Disbursement and out of office expenses</u>
<br/><br/><br/>

Please note that in providing you with our services, we may have to use the services of
outer experts or professionals, such as barrister, interpreters, etc. If we have to use the
services of other professionals, for instance a barrister to represent you in court or to
draft documents, you are responsible for paying the fees of the professional or expert,
and the fee you have agreed for our services would not include the fee for other professionals
we engage on your behalf.
Before we engage any professional on your behalf, we would normally uniform you and
ask you to make payment in advance of using the services of that professional, failing
which we would not be able to use the services of the professional.
<br/><br/><br/>


<u>Engaging Experts</u>
<br/><br/><br/>



We will only engage experts using objective criteria. In a situation where you may have
need for interpreters, medical attention/report, etc, we will engage only professionals
who are registered with a recognised accreditation body. Recognised bodies for interpreters
include, The National Register for Public Service Interpreters, Metropolitan Police
Test, Diploma in Public Service Interpreting, etc while the General Medical Council regulates
medical doctors in the UK. The Nursing and Midwifery Council is another important 
regulatory body since we may be engaging the services of Nurses and Midwives during
the cause of our work.
It is also our company policy not to engage the services of the client’s family member or
friend in order to avoid a conflict of interest in providing a professional service.
<br/><br/><br/>


<u>The success of the matter</u>
<br/><br/><br/>

We will try our best to get a favourable outcome on all matters. However, success is not
guaranteed and the outcome is dependent upon the Secretary of State’s decision in respect
of the merit of your case. We do not operate on a “no win no fee basis”. 

<br/><br/><br/>


<u>Report on progress</u>
<br/><br/><br/>


We will update you by telephone or in writing with progress on your matter and any developments
as and when they arise. We will always try to keep you informed of any unexpected
delays or changes in the character of the work. You may enquire at any time
from us about a progress report.
<br/><br/><br/>


<u>How long it will take to resolve the matter</u>
<br/><br/><br/>

At this stage, we are unable to give you an exact time in which your matter will be concluded.
The time taken varies depending upon your case and the complexity of the matter.
You should be aware that the Home Office and High Commission decide on cases according
to their own time scales and we have no control over this.
<br/><br/><br/>

We are committed to promoting equality and diversity in all of our dealings with clients,
third parties and employees. Please contact us if you would like a copy of our equality

then this can lead to disciplinary action against us. The duty of confidentiality
applies to information about your affairs and general information.

having discussed the matter with you, having obtained your consent to disclose
information or where we are under a professional obligation to do so.


<br/><br/><br/>


<u>Inspection of files and quality standards</u>
<br/><br/><br/>


The Office of The Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC) may review your file as
part of their regulatory role. In particular, they may need to access your file whilst 
checking my competence. The OISC does not require permission to inspect my client
files. Please be assured that they will maintain your confidentiality at all times.

<br/><br/><br/>


<u>Transfer of File</u>
<br/><br/><br/>


If you wish to instruct other firms to deal with your matter, we will transfer your file to
another adviser but you will still need to pay our fees.
We will always release your file whether you have paid us or not. We may take action in
the County court to recover our fees should you refuse to pay. 
<br/><br/><br/>


<u>Papers held by us and document custody</u>
<br/><br/><br/>


On completion of matters, we will return your original documents to you unless otherwise
